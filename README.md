# Cylon on the "Tiny Stick", part deux

## Intro

In today's session with Jeff, there were a couple things I wanted to show, but my demo cylon code didn't have good examples:
* Doing code without embedded waits
* Using enums
* solid commenting

We've been playing around with getting a "cylon" (or knight-rider) working on the tiny stick...this project is gonna be my take at implementing that whilst demonstrating good software engineering principles.
